At a client, currently we are facing a very interesting problem: we have a lot of tiny little applications which are all monitoring different parts of different applications. Some of them are written in Java some of them in C#, or maybe even in Python, some of them have very simple logic, some of them are much more complex and obscurely hides it within a couple of stored procedures. As this is a financial firm, it is very important to react in time if certain metrics go into the danger zone, otherwise the underlying problem might have a big financial impact. 

Some of the features these monitoring/reporting/alerting applications have in common: 

- a periodic observation of a system for health check
- customizable logic around the alerting, sometimes via using multiple observations rolled up over time (i.e. standard deviation over a moving time window)
- customizable email templates, which are using the details of the observation

<a href="http://riemann.io">Riemann</a> came into the picture because of it's flexibility compared to Nagios, and because it's programmability for alerts compared to Graphana & Graphite which we use for creating our dashboards and near-realtime post-mortem analysis of our distributed systems if something goes wrong.   

Riemann's mission statement also sounds convincing enough to jump into the setup:
 
> Riemann provides low-latency, transient shared state for systems with many moving parts.

My biggest concerns against Riemann are: 
 
 * how does it scale? 
 * How hard it is going to be to explain Clojure to our infrastructure guys? 

**I will not answer these concerns in this post** but I will share the first steps of my proof of concept. 


#Proof of concept: setting up my own email templates in Riemann.

Goals: I want to be able to use my event data freely. I want to be able to define as many email templates as I feel like for specialized event streams, as a function of the data of my events.  If I can prove that Riemann can does that, that will be one big step in the Proof of Concept process. 

#Step 1. Setting up Riemann 

I went through the  <a href="http://riemann.io/quickstart.html">Riemann quickstart</a> and had the server setup, the test event was working, and this is how it looked like: 

I created the Riemann client in Ruby, using Interactive Ruby (IRB), sent the event to Riemann, and retrieved it through a query:

<pre><code>
$  r << { 
host: "www1", 
service: "http req", 
metric: 2.53, 
state: "critical", 
description: "Request took 2.53 seconds.", 
tags: ["http"]
}

ruby-1.9.3 :003 > r['service =~ "http%"']
[<Riemann::Event time: 1330041937, 
state: "critical", 
service: "http req", 
host: "www1", 
description: "Request took 2.53 seconds.", 
tags: ["http"], 
ttl: 300.0, 
metric_f: 2.5299999713897705>]
</code></pre>

#Step 2. Sending email about my own event 

In the second step I'm going to send an email about my event, and that email's body will contain the value of the "testfield" field on my event. 

The following IRB code submits my event with a field called "testfield" with a value "bla"

<pre><code>
$ irb -r riemann/client
irb(main):004:0> r = Riemann::Client.new
 => #<Riemann::Client ... >
irb(main):004:0> r << { testfield: "bla" }
=> nil
</code></pre>

I want to see an email containing "bla".


## 2.1. Writing tests for my filtering logic

Riemann provides a test framework to test your configuration, I followed <a href="http://riemann.io/howto.html#writing-tests">the guide to write tests</a>.
After spamming my inbox with loads of messages, and being a TDD enthusiast, I realized that I should point it out first :) 

So let's run the tester without any testcode:


<pre><code>
~/dev/riemann-0.2.9 $ bin/riemann test etc/riemann.config
INFO [2015-03-28 15:21:41,514] main - riemann.repl - REPL server {:port 5557, :host 127.0.0.1} online

Testing clojure.core

Ran 0 tests containing 0 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
</code></pre>

The tests are expressing my expectation, that I would like to see events turning up on my test tap called **:my-events** which are not nil in the :testfield. 


<pre><code>
(let [email (mailer {
					  :from "fromemail@address"
			          :host "...mysmtp..." 
				  	  :tls :yes 
				  	  :user "..." 
				  	  :pass "..." 
				  	  :port 587
					})]
		(streams
		     (tap :my-events (io (email "to-email@address")))
		)
)



(tests
  (deftest my-events-test
    ;; tests case 1: testfield is not nil
    (is (= (inject! [
                      { 
                      :service "an event with testfield"
                      :testfield "bla"
                      :time 1
                      }
                    ])
           {:my-events [ ;; I expect that my tap will contain this exact one event
                      { 
                      :service "an event with testfield"
                      :testfield "bla"
                      :time 1
                      }
            ]}))
    ;; tests case 2: testfield is nil
    (is (= (inject! [
                      { 
                        :service "an event without testfield"
                        :time 1
                      }
                    ])
           {:my-events []})) ;; I expect that my tap will contain no events

))
</code></pre>


Executing the test fails as expected:

<pre><code>
bin/riemann test etc/riemann.config
INFO [2015-03-28 15:54:59,110] main - riemann.repl - REPL server {:port 5557, :host 127.0.0.1} online

Testing riemann.config-test

FAIL in (my-events-test) (riemann.config:63)
expected: (= (inject! [{:service "an event without testfield", :time 1}]) {:my-events []})
  actual: (not (= {:my-events [{:service "an event without testfield", :time 1}]} {:my-events []}))

Ran 1 tests containing 2 assertions.
1 failures, 0 errors.
</code></pre>

To make my tests pass I used the **where*** function which enables me to define my filter as the function of my event.
Also for experimentation I put in a prn function, to see the actual event as well. 

<pre><code>
...
(streams
   (where* (fn [e](not (= nil (:testfield e))))
     (tap :my-events (io (email "to-email@address")))
     prn
   )
 )
 ....
</code></pre>

And the result: 

<pre><code>
bin/riemann test etc/riemann.config
INFO [2015-03-28 16:01:44,937] main - riemann.repl - REPL server {:port 5557, :host 127.0.0.1} online

Testing riemann.config-test
{:service "an event with testfield", :time 1, :testfield "bla"}

Ran 1 tests containing 2 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
</code></pre>


## 2.2 Let's use the default mailer in Riemann 

I started off with the first recommended solution on the <a href="http://riemann.io/howto.html">Riemann - How to page</a> and used the default mailer setup. Also as Riemann is using Postal in the background, I managed to set up after a bit of tweaking the right TLS based authentication with my own SMTP server. 

<pre><code>
(let [email (mailer {
					  :from "fromemail@address"
			          :host "...mysmtp..." 
				  	  :tls :yes 
				  	  :user "..." 
				  	  :pass "..." 
				  	  :port 587
					})]

</code></pre>

And, as expected, I got the email, I was happy to see the details, and the actual default email format Riemann chose to represent events:

## 2.3 Gaining control: fill out details from the event 

One step towards the template solution is to actually use the event fields in the body of the email. 
I did manage to achieve this via these steps:

- I had to use **smap** in the Riemann library to transform my email sending into an explicit function of the event
- I had to use Postal's send-message function directly so that I can get control over the :body tag 
- I used Clojure's str function to concatate the desired values adding up to this line: 

**:body (reduce str [ "test body: " (:testfield e) ] )**

Putting it into context:

<pre><code>
(streams
        (where* (fn [e](not (= nil (:testfield e))))
     		(tap :my-events (io (
	            (smap (fn [e] 
	                (postal.core/send-message 
	                  { 	
	                  	  :host "...mysmtp..." 
	                  	  :tls :yes 
	                  	  :user "..." 
	                  	  :pass "..." 
	                  	  :port 587}  
	                  { 
		                  :from "fromemail@address" 
		                  :to "to-email@address" 
		                  :subject "My test subject" 
		                  :body (reduce str [ "test body: " (:testfield e) ] )
	                }
	              )
	            )
	          )
	          )))
          prn	
        )
  )
</code></pre>

So when I send exactly the same event again:

<pre><code>
irb(main):004:0> r << { testfield: "bla" }
=> nil
</code></pre>

It results in a nice email with the body actually containing my testfield's value, great!!!

#Step 3. Introducing Selmer for templating

In order to get to a template based email, I needed a template language. I wanted to have an existing HTML template, which I can change from the config. 

<pre><code>
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot;&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;My beautiful email&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Hello &#123;&#123;testfield&#125;&#125;!&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

After researching the available Clojure templating solutions I chose to use <a href="https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer">Selmer</a> because simply that was the closest to my current mindset, I haven't spent too much time on comparing other solutions, I am sure that if you want, you can integrate with any other templating solutions with very similar steps. 

In order to enable Selmer I just downloaded the jar (I had it in my local maven repo after playing with it in leiningen) and added it to the classpath:

<pre><code>
~/dev/riemann-0.2.9 $ export EXTRA_CLASSPATH=lib/selmer-0.8.2.jar 
~/dev/riemann-0.2.9 $ bin/riemann etc/riemann.config 
</code></pre>


And this is the riemann.config to enable it:

<pre><code class="clojure">
(use 'selmer.parser)

(selmer.parser/set-resource-path! "/Users/balopat/dev/riemann-0.2.9/etc/")

(streams
   (where* (fn [e] (not (= nil (:testfield e))))
       prn 
       (tap :my-events 
          (io 
            (smap (fn [e] 
               (let [msg-body [
                                   {:type "text/html"
                                   :content (render-file "template.html" e) }
                                   ] 
                               ]
                 (postal.core/send-message 
                   { :host "..." 
                     :tls :yes 
                     :user "..." 
                     :pass  "..."
                     :port 587}  
                   { 
                   	:from "fromemail@address" 
                   	:to "to-email@address" 
                   	:subject "Templatized fun"                 
                   	:body msg-body 
                   }
                 )                
               )
               )
            ) 
          )
      )
   )
)
</code></pre>

And the result:

Yaay! 

#4. Conclusion 

Riemann is as hackable/transformable as Clojure which basically sets the functional limits to nothing. 
Clojure itself is a matter of taste, but I personally think that having a testable, functional language as configuration is a big plus. 

As per the proof of concept, I believe the functionally Riemann is very promising. In terms of non-functional requirements I will have to look into it more heavily and benchmark it to determine if this is going to be a viable solution or not. 

I hope you enjoyed the walkthrough, please let me know if I overcomplicated things, I would love to learn more about the technologies involved!
